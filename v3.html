My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively.

I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following:

Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020.

We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount.

Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B.

This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years.

I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?

Regards,

A`;

Hope you guys will know the answer.

We are a small business, and so far only had full time employees. Now we are a part time employee (12-13hr per week over 4 days) starting.
How many days holiday should they get per year (our full time employees get 28).
When they take 1 day of holiday, is it 8hrs (=2.5 days because they only work part time) or 1 day? for example, they want to be off one the Monday where they have 3 hours normally. Do I deduct 1 day of holiday for that?
Do they accrue the holidays as they gain more time with the company or do they get them on day 1 (so for example if they are entitled to 10 days, can they theoretically ask them one week two of their employment)
Thank you!`;

Our company is required to submit gender pay gap reports this year, doing that first time actually.

Is there any chance you could help me and clarify what pay period we need to use which year, 2023 or 2022?

If the snapshot date is 5th Apr, GOV says the pay period to use for your gender pay gap data is 1st Apr to 30th Apr, but would it be for the last year, I assume, for 2022 (As I don't have payroll data for full April this year)?
And what about annual bonus pay period, would it be from 1st Apr 2021 to 1st Apr 2022, or 2022 to 23.

document.getElementById("text").value=`I have an an online business which includes and Ebay shop and my own website. I sell bicycle parts and have some trade accounts that I buy from and sell. This has operated for approximately 7 years but has remained a very small, part time run business.

I have had a letter from a German legal firm who represents a client who bought 2 saddles from me in Dec 22. I buy the saddles from a large supplier who import them from a world known manufacturer in Italy. They are described as nubuck leather on our suppliers trade site. They say their client has had the saddles tested they are microfibre and not nubuck leather. Therefore, I am alledged to be misleading, and have alledged misconduct towards german customers because my product description says they are nubuck leather. I have contacted my supplier who says they use the same description as given to them by the manufacturer. They have forwarded details to the manufacturer and await a response.

At no point have I has any contact with the alledged customer and currently I have not acknowledged or responded to the letter.

The letter includes a cease and desist declaration to be signed by tomorrow, 28th February. It also includes a claim for 2.438 euros as costs incured by their client to date, payable by the 7th March. I have removed the saddle from sale in Germany.

Although the letter is quite extensive in its details, it totals 16 pages. They have provided no receipt or invoice from the purchase on the two saddles. I have checked our sales records and have never sold these saddles to a customer in Germany, either as a pair or individually. This appears to be a quite a discrepancy in the claim.

They ask for information of how many these saddles I have sold, the turnover and profit achieved.

They also give an example of a incorrect leather material labelling which went court in Cologne for a sum of 42,000 euros.

This is a very short summary of the current situation I find myself in. I have contacted a legal firm who have requested £1250 + vat.

I feel that I need to do something to resolve the issue, so I would welcome any suggestions on how to move forward.

To begin with, We have a Retail/Warehouse Commercial building about 10.000 sq. ft in capacity that we are going Listing for rent shortly, We have spoken to two agents & would appreciate some points of view please.

We have a fair bit of experience with a rogue commercial tenant before, left no bills really but cost a lot through legal means, Time & lost rent.
Have some experience with a smaller Tenant (Hair D) reasonable to deal with to be fair.
Residential experience run of the mill issues.
Commercial lease advice & some of the topics that have come up.
Business Rates ( Basic Research) It appears that the landlord could be responsible for Rates, So do you have the Tenant pay it separately or Do you include Council Rates into the rent?
Anyone experienced this, if you didn't build the rates into the rent could this promote the Tenant to only pay you the base rent & front run you into paying the rates out of your Base rent & effectively compromise you.
Could this work, If you allow prospective Tenant to be liable for payment do you ask for 1 years Rates premium up front on top of general deposit & seek cert of payment every year.
If there is no payment after a small time allowance then the lease can be terminated, We can have the building back/enter immediately & it is not optional, instead of receiving the building back in a reasonable way?
How do Market Rent if you want to negotiate base rent after incentives?
Or do you price it high to begin with?
Any insight would be favourable.

Thank you.`;

Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat.

new here, be gentle. I have browsed the internet and it brought me here to a similar post about paying for commuting. I basically need to know if we should be paying our employee his commuting time.

We have no base, but we do provide the van, insurance, fuel, etc. Commute can vary as driving to customers' home/work sites but generally up to a max of an hour/hour and a half.

Do we abide by the ECJ ruling that it does count as working time? Is there any set requirements to qualify for this ruling or is it a blanket ruling - no base, hes paid regardless of time commuting.

How can you track commuting time so they don't 'miscalculate' their hours claimed?

I spoke with the hiring manager who thought I would be a great fit with all of my previous experience and encouraged me to apply. Once I applied and made three aware they said “great, HR will be in touch regarding dates for interview”
Part of our internal application process includes having to provide a copy of our most recent 1 to 1 paperwork. In my last 1 to 1 I mentioned to my manager when talking about areas of improvement, that I had suffered from anxiety specifically relating to travel and public speaking but that I was taking medication, had received therapy and was working actively to improve this. This information was therefore included on my paperwork.
The role I have applied for involves travelling a lot for meetings and also has public speaking/delivering presentations. I fully understand the requirements of the role and have done these things in my current and previous roles so was not expecting any special treatment or to not travel.
Unfortunately I received a call from HR today and I am not being offered an interview. The feedback provided was “your CV, experience and internal application was really good however there were some concerns regarding your 1 to 1 paperwork where we noticed you mentioned you had anxiety surrounding travel and public speaking. Both of these are a huge part of the role therefore we would prefer for you to work on this and come back and apply at a later date”. They also mentioned on the call that they noticed I’d expressed an interest in another line of work.
I understand logically why they don’t want to take me forward, however the information on my paperwork was between myself and my manager and I never thought that my mental health would have prevented me from being offered an interview.
I probably won’t take this any further but wanted to get some advice from people in the know as I may need to consider not including personal information in my 1 to 1 paperwork going forward if it will negatively impact future job applications.

It frustrates me when I ask for a reference for employee, who has dedicated a chunk of their career to an organisation, only to receive the stock response of employment dates and "it's our policy not to complete reference forms blah blah". I appreciate companies are trying to protect themselves, but they shouldn't be writing anything in a reference that they can't factually justify anyway.

When someone has dedicated several years to your organisation I think it's incredibly unsupportive for that organisation to refuse to support their career any further by issuing a helpful and detailed statement about their previous role.

I need your help with something.

I run a hardware and DIY shop.

Last year, a man came in and wanted to buy superglue.

I was supposed to ask for ID from people who looked under 25 when buying age restricted products, even though the man looked over 18.

But the man just put the money on the counter and walked out with the glue, in fact paying slightly more than what the glue cost.

I asked the shopkeeper next door if this was legal. She told me that “Force-purchasing” wasn't legally actionable and that the man had paid.

On some further research, I gathered that force-purchasing is where a person pays the listed price for something, but the sale wasn't approved by the seller. Legally it seems like a grey area.

I'm concerned I may be accused of selling age-restricted items to under-18s.

I've written to my local trading standards about the matter, but I still haven't got a response.

What can I do if I've been a victim of “Force-purchasing”? Could I report it to the police?

I didn’t wish to be a director also as I working elsewhere also. So, we set the business up and I got the first client with my own staff, when it came to him giving me staff, he couldn’t manage to get anything, so I had to do it myself. he didn’t do any of the tasks we agreed in the beginning, when I told him I want my share back he said he cant give it as he it the registered manager and more at risk. Which I found a silly excuse. Now I have proof of us agreeing us to be 50: 50. Also I would want to make a partnership agreement to ensure he cant just make random decisions about the business without my input as currently he is saying he would want to take a salary from the business also. Which I do not agree to. I wanted to know if a partnership agreement is legally binding and what can I do if he continues not to hold up his end.

document.getElementById("text").value=`So I have a customer. Let's call them 'Widget Manufacturing,' a big global brand name and I trust them to eventually pay me. As a video production agency, they push some of their stuff through a PR agency. So we come up with the concept and then the PR agency pays us. I trust the PR agency as I know someone else who worked with them and have worked with them in the past.

The issue is the PR agency is stalling about signing the contract because the original customer is not signing a contract with them.

So I have a cunning plan. The idea is I'll send the PR agency an initial invoice for half the money to get paid upfront and comfortably cover all my costs. As part of the invoice, it will state the second payment will arrive on a specified future date, therefore creating a contract between us, albeit not a signed one. i.e. When they pay the money upfront, the invoice will form the contract.

I expect the upfront payment to arrive on time and the payment after everything is delivered to arrive a few months late because this is my experience (and the experience of the other party who worked with them).

So does anyone have an opinion on forming a legal contract using this method?`;

They have chased ever since but last month the employer told them they were let go because their work wasn't up to scratch and that the Company had been dissolved and they wouldn't be getting a penny. Employee was there less than a year.

I've looked into it and old co is still active at Companies House.

Just a question on asset lease we had back in 2016, we acquired manufacturing equipment with a 60 month term and an early exit to change over the title deeds at 60 months (Jan 2021).
1. The company we used changed name 3x within this period not notifying us.
2. We never got any asset schedules for VAT
3. we were not contacted to be notified of the 60 month term coming up.
4. as it was years ago, we were sure we contacted them to cancel this but being over 2 years ago I really cant find anything, our accountant was changed (falling out and they held our books to ransom).
5. with a change over in title generally say 1 month extra plus say £150 fee...we did not check this and assumed it was all complete

The tune of overpaid monthly's to this company is £~12K
the asset interest was already about 40% on the actual cost of the equipment.

As we have used asset finance and alot of bank lines, we let this go by the way side, change over of names to didnt help.

Wonder if this is a write off or there is usually an amicable situation for the money to be returned?
contract states written notice until canceled...but 2 years 1 month for an asset thats been paid almost 3x over.

Any suggestions welcomed. I have written to them now laying out whats happened.

Last night out the blue she received an email from her manager via HR telling her the company is not happy with her performance and they want to give her 2 months notice + small amount of gardening leave and they want her to sign her agreement in next 2 weeks.

Some points to make:
She had been told 2 or 3 times over the last year that she was underperforming but all her requests to discuss it further were ignored. She literally has no idea how she is underperforming or what to do to put it right.
The KPI's of her team are BETTER than the KPI's of her managers other team!
She returned to work in October having had a few weeks off for depression/stress - possibly/probably work related although I don't have further info.
She recently requested a minor alteration to her hours (she wanted to do 4.5 days per week rather than 5 days per week to enable her to do some volunteering - good for mental health/work-life balance). Rejected.
At no time was there any 'protected conversation' related to the nature of the email - it literally came out of the blue, on email, no verbal discussion at all.
The manager who told HR to send the email is supposed to be retiring soon and has hired a replacement. But now she has suddenly decided to stay but the person taken on to replace her is also staying. Sounds all a bit fishy and premeditated to me but difficult to prove it was al part of the plan I guess.
Goes without saying the company are not making any redundancies and redundancy has never been mentioned.
Company have a recent history of forcing people out in similar circumstances - clearly it's run by pretty revolting people.
Understandably she is distraught and sickened by the whole thing (and being miles away from home/friends/family with a history of depression - particularly cruel)
Strangely she wants to stay with the company as she enjoys working with her team. Personally after all this I don't think it's possible, I'd be running a mile.

To my limited knowledge of employment law it looks like the company have done everything wrong and if a constructive dismissal case were brought the judge would find in her favour immediately. Agreed?

A few questions:
What should she do now?! Resign immediately? She is going to continue going to this away job for the next 2 days then she is meant to be in the office for Thurs/Fri.
How should she reply to the letter?
Does she need/would she benefit from a union rep? How would she find one?
Do employment lawyers take on cases like these on a no win-no fee basis?

The yong lady is 25, lives with me (I'm her sponsor). I assisted her with getting a bank account, getting a BRP, registering with GP and dentist, getting an NI number and a whole load of other stuff as is typical with all the Ukrainians I hosted. I also got her a job and she worked for 9 months in this large company, on PAYE, all fine. She was happy there. She went to work 5 days a week, socialised on other days, went on dates, did all the things kids do.

But an older Ukrainian lady, who happens to be settled here, was starting a competing business, offered my guest a job and enticed her to leave her original employer. The attraction was that my guest would be working in an environment with all Ukrainian speakers (there wasn't extra salary or anything). But she was told she'd have a proper contract, get paid officially etc. I was happy for her.

My guest accordingly left her job to start with the new employer last month. However, the new employer said that there would first be a period of volunteering to redecorate the premises before opening to the public. My guest "volunteered" over a couple of weeks (without any compensation of course). She was fine with it. After all, she was helping another Ukrainian, wasn't she?

Then the time came to open the business and my guest was told she needed to work for free for a few days to see how she manages in the job. She did that (against my advice). Apparently, that kind of arrangement is not unusual in Ukraine.

Now the time's come for a contract, she's been told that the employer is still working things out with her lawyer and that for the next couple of months it will be cash payments (as, apparently, she's having trouble opening a bank account!).

My guest doesn't see anything dodgy here, but I'm distinctly uncomfortable that someone is possibly taking advantage of her. She might even end up working for a month and not get any salary!

Given she's 25, though, is it even any business of mine?! If it is, what would you recommend I do?`;

We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients.

After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons.

Business has 2 equal directors

BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow.

We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets.

CH & HMRC in good order

A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won’t cover.

Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork

Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis.

I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start.

This I’m sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option.

Bit of a backstory:

I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on.

I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k.

I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid.

Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in.

The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things.

I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided.

Someone recently sent me a screenshot of 3 clauses in a contract sent to them by a new prospective employer.

“Upon completion of the probation period, either of us can terminate your employment by giving written notice of 12 weeks.”

“We may at our discretion terminate your employment without notice and make a payment in lieu of notice“.

I haven’t included 3, as it’s the usual “summary dismissal for gross negligence” clause.

I’m a one man band now, and not an employment lawyer, so my experience with this stuff is not up to date. However, since when did employers acquire the right to dismiss without notice, apparently without a reason, in a specific notice period. Notice periods are for employees, not employers, surely? Taken on their own, these two clauses could feasibly be used to flout redundancy laws.

This is all that’s been sent to me and I am wondering if there may be more which precedes this, which puts it into context.

To be clear, this isn’t a client, or a professional engagement of any kind, just a casual request, and this is all they wanted to disclose.

However when do we strike the company off normally my main question?

We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn’t liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption.

Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I’ve put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business.

managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn’t accout for all the time I spend.
I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel
I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash.
I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion.
Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the
process of expulsion and dissolution that
might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance that this is the correct way to deal with it. I have the greatest of sympathy for their personal issues, but also feel incredibly hurt and angry that my mental health has been jeopardised and my time wasted by their deceit and incompetence. I can’t see any other way out of this mess in which they can stay involved with the business without causing me the stress of anticipating and sorting out their next mistake/worrying about how much I trust them.

incredibly sad that it has come to this, but amnot sure that feeling sorry for someone is the best basis to continue in business with them. Sorry for the essay - any advice gratefully rceived.`;

I wonder if anyone can offer some advice please.

I run a small interior design consultancy. For one of my clients I ordered a composite bath (£4000). It was delivered in a crate, without the feet and before it was ready for install so it was put into a garage for storage, still in all the packing. Now that it is ready for install, the crate was opened and I discovered the item is completely shattered - it was clearly dropped very forcefully at some point before being delivered to me.

I contacted the supplier and they say that I had 48 hours to note any discrepancies so the liability lies with me.

Can anyone suggest any legal basis for pushing back against this? The item was clearly broken on their side, whoever did it would have known, but I feel like they are trying to shift the cost onto me! Is this legal? They clearly delivered me a broken product, it's just that it took me a few weeks to open the crate to discover it.

Thanks for any help or advice!`;

They haven't paid my invoice, so I issued a county court summons.

The court tells me the claim was returned "unserved" as it's alleged it's the wrong address.
I am certain the company have lied by claiming this isn't their address. I know they are still at this address.Their website actually states it.

Does anyone know what I do now? The email from the court service today says if the address is correct that no further action is required,and I can request judgment -but I've already requested judgement 4 weeks ago.I only found out about the unserved situation today (which begs the question why didn't the court inform me of the alleged wrong address months ago when I first issued the claim).`;

We have put some palletized structures on our grassed field which is a separate curtilage to the house at no more than 2.5 meters high and have no footings or anything, just sat on the field and are not fixed to the ground in anyway.

The council in question is Winchester city council and they are saying that we are breeching the planning act, now my understanding is that under the permitted development rights you can have temporary structures on your land without the need for planning.

Any help would be much appreciated.`;

My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick.

I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband.

Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?`;
